    <string name="AguaClara_Desc"> AguaClara Cornell upholds and protects the fundamental human right
        to access safe drinking water. We are committed to the ongoing development of resilient,
        gravity-powered drinking water and wastewater treatment technologies. Students lead the
        innovation process, learn from each other, and foster a collaborative environment where
        diversity is celebrated, failures are learning opportunities, and success is shared.
        We research, invent, and design technologies that are implemented by partner organizations
        and managed by communities to bring safe water on tap!
